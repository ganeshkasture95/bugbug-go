# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables researchers to connect with companies through research programs and provides automatic notifications to companies when researchers join their programs. The system will facilitate the connection process and ensure companies are informed about new researcher participants in real-time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to connect with companies through their research programs, so that I can participate in relevant research opportunities and collaborate with industry partners.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a researcher views available programs THEN the system SHALL display all active company research programs with connection options
2. WHEN a researcher selects a program to join THEN the system SHALL initiate the connection process between the researcher and the company
3. WHEN a researcher successfully connects to a program THEN the system SHALL store the connection relationship in the database
4. IF a researcher is already connected to a program THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate connections and display appropriate status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a company, I want to be notified when researchers join my research programs, so that I can promptly engage with new participants and manage program enrollment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a researcher successfully connects to a company's program THEN the system SHALL send an immediate notification to the company
2. WHEN a company receives a researcher connection notification THEN the notification SHALL include researcher profile information and program details
3. WHEN multiple researchers connect to a program THEN the system SHALL send individual notifications for each connection
4. IF a notification fails to send THEN the system SHALL retry the notification and log any persistent failures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a company administrator, I want to view all researchers connected to my programs, so that I can manage program participants and track enrollment metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a company administrator accesses their program dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all connected researchers for each program
2. WHEN viewing connected researchers THEN the system SHALL show researcher profiles, connection dates, and program-specific information
3. WHEN a company has multiple programs THEN the system SHALL organize researcher connections by program
4. IF no researchers are connected to a program THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure connection data integrity and audit trails, so that the platform maintains reliable researcher-company relationships and compliance records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a researcher-company connection is created THEN the system SHALL log the connection event with timestamp and participant details
2. WHEN connection data is modified THEN the system SHALL maintain an audit trail of all changes
3. WHEN querying connection data THEN the system SHALL ensure data consistency across all related entities
4. IF a connection process fails THEN the system SHALL log the error details and provide meaningful error messages to users
